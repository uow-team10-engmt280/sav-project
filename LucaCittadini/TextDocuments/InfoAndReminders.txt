The sequence of state changes:
IDLE --> LISTENING
LISTENING --> MOVING
MOVING --> PICKUP
PICKUP --> MOVING
MOVING --> DROPOFF
DROPOFF --> MOVING
MOVING --> PARKING
PARKING --> COMPLETED

1. Could create seperate functions to control the servos in another file to just import and call them.

2. Don't forget to remove some comments like "# type: ignore", this is used to ignore problems that 
we know aren't problems, but should remove later just incase there are problems.

3. EnableA for the motor driver is wired up to GPIO13 on the raspberry Pi, I believe this is PWM capable,
however EnableB is wired up to GPIO26, which I don't believe is PWM capable. NEED TO CHECK THIS 

4. The small servo is Wired up to GPIO5, the large servo is wired up to GPIO0, I'm not sure but I think 
that both the servos need PWM signals and I don't think that these GPIO pins are PWM capable. NEED TO CHECK
THIS

5. Here are the GPIO pins

    To be used as OUTPUT:
        - GPIO6 --> PHASEA (motor driver, ON/OFF)
        - GPIO13 --> ENABLEA (motor driver, speed in %)
        - GPIO19 --> PHASEB (motor driver, ON/OFF)
        - GPIO26 --> ENABLEB (motor driver, speed in %)
        - GPIO5 --> Small servo Control
        - GPIO0 --> Large servo Control
    To be used as INPUT:
        - GPIO2 --> Range sensor output  

6. We don't have a connection to the motor driver MODE pin. If we get another PCB then we should get add this 
connection (should also redesign to accommodate the PWMs needed)

7. Maybe add something to the SystemLogic programme (or MachineVisionMain??) to wait until the correct list has
been returned through the function

8. What would "end the programme nicely" entail - (not actually sure if this is a thing or if it just involves
GPIO cleanup)

9. Make sure that each programme is written so it can just be imported as a function and used like so

10. NEED TO FIX THE "MachineVisionMain.py" PROGRAMME***
