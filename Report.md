# 280 Report â€“ section 2: Design Development


## Break this up into 3 parts: 
a.	Overview of design considerations + final design decision at the end
b.	The design development includes the entire system
-	SolidWorks
-	PCB
-	Software
-	Drawings?
-	Wiring?
c.	Need to also discuss how this was split up amongst the team

### This section is worth 60%, if the full report is 20 pages, then as a rough estimate, this section should be 12 pages

## SOLIDSWORKS CONSIDERATIONS:
-	Arm design
-	Claw design
-	How each part fits together
-	The Chassis
-	The base of chassis (beneath the motor)
-	Reflectance sensor
-	Range sensor
-	How the arm is held
-	How the battery sits
-	Why there are some odd pieces
## PCB DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
